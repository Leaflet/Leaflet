Displays data aggregated by the ISEA3H discrete global grid system.  The data can, e.g., be delivered by using <a href="https://github.com/giscience/measures-rest">Measures REST</a> (a framework to deliver data aggregated by the grid) or <a href="https://github.com/giscience/geogrid">geogrid</a> (a library for handling the grid in case that you want to aggregate data manually).
