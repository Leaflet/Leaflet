Leaflet.Autocomplete is to expand the autosugestion plugin with the ability to geocode and show data on the map in the way you think you need. The <a href="https://tomik23.github.io/Leaflet.Autocomplete/">DEMO</a> is based on the use of OpenstreetMap Nominatim to locate places by address. Accessible, with full support for ARIA attributes and keyboard interactions.
