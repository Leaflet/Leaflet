Allmaps plugin for Leaflet. This plugin allows displaying georeferenced [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) images on a Leaflet map. 100,000s of (historical) maps are available through IIIF, across libraries, archives and museums worldwide. The plugin works by loading [Georeference Annotations](https://preview.iiif.io/api/georef/extension/georef/) and uses WebGL to transform images from a IIIF image server to overlay them on their correct geographical position. See [allmaps.org](https://www.allmaps.org) for more information.
