This is an accessibility statement from Leaflet.

<svg class="a11y-icon" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M20.5 6c-2.61.7-5.67 1-8.5 1s-5.89-.3-8.5-1L3 8c1.86.5 4 .83 6 1v13h2v-6h2v6h2V9c2-.17 4.14-.5 6-1l-.5-2zM12 6c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2s-.9-2-2-2-2 .9-2 2 .9 2 2 2z"></path></svg>

### Conformance status

The
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility
for people with disabilities.
It defines three levels of conformance:
Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

Leaflet is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1
[Level A](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc1).
Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform
to the accessibility standard.

### Measures to support accessibility

Leaflet strives to provide accessible maps.
[Accessibility issues to be addressed](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aaccessibility) are tracked and discussed
on Github.
