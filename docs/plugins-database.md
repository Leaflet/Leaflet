## Leaflet Plugins database

While Leaflet is meant to be as lightweight as possible, and focuses on a core set of features, an easy way to extend its functionality is to use third-party plugins. Thanks to the awesome community behind Leaflet, there are literally hundreds of nice plugins to choose from.
