During the last year or so, mainstream web browsers have subtly changed the way touchscreens work; unfortunately, Leaflet 1.6.0 and previous versions now exhibit some quirks on touchscreens.

Leaflet 1.7.1 fixes that by bringing several changes to how `PointerEvent`s are detected and handled, and using passive touch event listeners when available.

The release was supposed to be numbered as 1.7.0, but a problem with the NPM dependencies appeared at the last minute, generating a bad build. Version 1.7.0 has been marked as deprecated in NPM, and shouldn't be used - use 1.7.1 instead.

Besides that, there's a bunch of small bug and documentation fixes, detailed in [the changelog](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Thanks to everyone who sent a fix, no matter how small!

To get the new release, update your dependencies in your favorite package manager, or check the [downloads page](https://leafletjs.com/download.html).

Cheers,<br>
The Leaflet team.
