Besides that, there's a bunch of small bug and documentation fixes, detailed in [the changelog](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Thanks to everyone who sent a fix, no matter how small!

To get the new release, update your dependencies in your favorite package manager, or check the [downloads page](https://leafletjs.com/download.html).
