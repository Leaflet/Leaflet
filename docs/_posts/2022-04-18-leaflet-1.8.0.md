We have just released Leaflet v1.8.0, a culmination of 1.5 years of development. This is a huge release focused on **bug fixes**, major **reliability** and **accessibility** improvements, **cleaning up** legacy code, and numerous improvements to documentation, development workflow and release process. A culmination of hundreds of contributions, and a preparation for bigger changes to come. üçÉ From now on, releases will become much more frequent.

I'm making this release just as an [air raid alert](https://observablehq.com/@mourner/sirens) is sounding outside, in Kyiv, warning about an imminent Russian air strike. This release is dedicated to Ukrainian fight for freedom and democracy against the Russian invasion üá∫üá¶ (see how you can [support Ukraine here](https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua/)).

Thanks to our amazing community for all your help and patience. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè Special thanks to [@johnd0e](https://github.com/johnd0e) who revived Leaflet development after long stagnation and made the biggest contributions, [@Falke-Design](https://github.com/Falke-Design) for doing the bulk of the work organizing development and preparing the release, [@Malvoz](https://github.com/Malvoz) for his numerous accessibility contributions, and [@jonkoops](https://github.com/jonkoops) for help with workflow automations. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Cheers,<br>
The Leaflet team.
