Leaflet is a modern open-source JavaScript library for **mobile-friendly interactive maps**.
It is developed by [Vladimir Agafonkin][] with a team of dedicated [contributors][].
Weighing just about 30 KB of gzipped JS code, it has all the [features][] most developers ever need for online maps.

Leaflet is designed with *simplicity*, *performance* and *usability* in mind.
It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box,
taking advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 on modern browsers while being accessible on older ones too.
It can also be extended with many [plugins][],
has a beautiful, easy to use and [well-documented][] API
and a simple, readable [source code][] that is a joy to [contribute][] to.

For more information, check out the [official website][].

We're happy to meet new contributors.
If you want to **get involved** with Leaflet development, check out the [contribution guide][contribute].
Let's make the best open-source library for maps that can possibly exist!
