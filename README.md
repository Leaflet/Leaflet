Leaflet was created 11 years ago by [Volodymyr Agafonkin](https://agafonkin.com), a Ukrainian citizen living in Kyiv.

Russian bombs are now falling over Volodymyr's hometown. His family, his friends, his neighbours, thousands and thousands of absolutely wonderful people, are either seeking refuge or fighting for their lives.

Russian soldiers have already killed tens of thousands of civilians, including women and children, and are committing mass war crimes like gang rapes, executions, looting, and targeted bombings of civilian shelters and places of cultural significance. The death toll keeps rising, and Ukraine needs your help.

As Volodymyr [expressed a few days before the invasion](https://twitter.com/LeafletJS/status/1496051256409919489):

> If you want to help, educate yourself and others on the Russian threat, follow reputable journalists, demand severe Russian sanctions and Ukrainian support from your leaders, protest the war, reach out to Ukrainian friends, donate to Ukrainian charities. Just don't be silent.

Ukrainians are recommending the [Come Back Alive](https://savelife.in.ua/en/) charity. For other options, see [StandWithUkraine](https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua).

If an appeal to humanity doesn't work for you, I'll appeal to your egoism: the future of Ukrainian citizens is the future of Leaflet.

It is chilling to see Leaflet being used for [documenting Russia's war crimes](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/), [factual reporting of the war](https://liveuamap.com/) and for coordination of humanitarian efforts across Europe. We commend these uses of Leaflet.

If you support the actions of the Russian government (even after reading all this), do everyone else a favour and [carry some seeds in your pocket](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/feb/25/ukrainian-woman-sunflower-seeds-russian-soldiers-video).

Yours truly,<br>
Leaflet maintainers.

Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for **mobile-friendly interactive maps**.
Weighing just about 42 KB of gzipped JS plus 4 KB of gzipped CSS code, it has all the mapping [features][] most developers ever need.

Leaflet is designed with *simplicity*, *performance* and *usability* in mind.
It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms out of the box,
taking advantage of modern browser features while being accessible on older ones too.
It can be extended with a huge amount of [plugins][],
has a beautiful, easy to use and [well-documented][] API
and a simple, readable [source code][] that is a joy to [contribute][] to.

## Download
To use Leaflet in your project, you can download it in several ways depending on your setup. Here are the available options:

1. Download from the Official Website
You can download the latest version of Leaflet directly from the [official download page].
After downloading unzip the downloaded archive to your websiteâ€™s directory and add this to the head of your HTML code:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/leaflet.css" />
<script src="/path/to/leaflet.js"></script>
```
2. Using a Hosted Version of Leaflet
If you prefer to include Leaflet in your project via a CDN, you can link to the latest version directly in your HTML file:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.3/dist/leaflet.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.3/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
```
This is a simple and quick way to include Leaflet without downloading the files locally.

3. Using npm (Node Package Manager)
If you are working on a project using Node.js or bundlers like Webpack or Parcel, you can install Leaflet via npm:
```bash
npm install leaflet
```
After installing, you can import Leaflet into your project:
```javascript
import L from 'leaflet';
```
4. Using Yarn
Alternatively, you can install Leaflet using Yarn:
```bash
yarn add leaflet
```
5. Building Leaflet Locally
If you want to work with the source code or make modifications, you can clone the repository and build it yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.git
cd Leaflet
npm install
npm run build
```
This will create a dist folder containing the built version of Leaflet that you can include in your projects.
