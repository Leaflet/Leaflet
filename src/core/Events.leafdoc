@namespace Event objects


Whenever a class inheriting from `Evented` fires an event, a listener function
will be called with an event argument, which is a plain object containing
information about the event. For example:

```js
map.on('click', function(ev) {
    alert(ev.latlng); // ev is an event object (MouseEvent in this case)
});
```

The information available depends on the event type:
