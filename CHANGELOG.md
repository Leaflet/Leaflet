Leaflet Changelog
=================

## 0.3 (master)

### Major features

 * Added **Canvas backend** for vector layers (polylines, polygons, circles). This enables vector support on Android < 3, and it can also be optionally preferred over SVG for a performance gain in some cases. Thanks to [@florianf](https://github.com/florianf) for a big part of this work.

### Improvements

 * Improved `LatLng` constructor to be more tolerant (and throw descriptive error if latitude or longitude can't be interpreted as a number). [#136](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/136)
 * Improved circles performance by not drawing them if they're off the clip region.  
 * Improved browser-specific code to rely more on feature detection rather than user agent string.

### Bugfixes

 * Fixed crash on Android 3+ when panning or zooming (by [@florian](https://github.com/florianf)). [#137](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/137)
 * Fixed a bug that caused map overlays to appear blurry in some cases under WebKit browsers.
 * Fixed a bug where static properties of a child class would not override the parent ones.
 * Fixed broken popup `closePopup` option (by [@jgerigmeyer](https://github.com/jgerigmeyer)).

## 0.2.1 (2011-06-18)

 * Fixed regression that caused error in `TileLayer.Canvas`.

## 0.2 (2011-06-17)

### Major features

 * Added **WMS** support (`TileLayer.WMS` layer).
 * Added different **projections** support, having `EPSG:3857`, `EPSG:4326` and `EPSG:3395` out of the box (through `crs` option in `Map`). Thanks to [@Miroff](https://github.com/Miroff) & [@Komzpa](https://github.com/Komzpa) for great advice and explanation regarding this.
 * Added **GeoJSON** layer support.
 
### Improvements
 
#### Usability improvements
 
 * Improved panning performance in Chrome and FF considerably with the help of `requestAnimationFrame`. [#130](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/130)
 * Improved click responsiveness in mobile WebKit (now it happens without delay). [#26](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/26)
 * Added tap tolerance (so click happens even if you moved your finger slighly when tapping).
 * Improved geolocation error handling: better error messages, explicit timeout, set world view on locateAndSetView failure. [#61](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/61)
 
#### API improvements

 * Added **MultiPolyline** and **MultiPolygon** layers. [#77](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/77) 
 * Added **LayerGroup** and **FeatureGroup** layers for grouping other layers.
 * Added **TileLayer.Canvas** for easy creation of canvas-based tile layers.
 * Changed `Circle` to be zoom-dependent (with radius in meters); circle of a permanent size is now called `CircleMarker`.
 * Added `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to map, markers and paths; added map `mousemove` event.
 * Added `setLatLngs`, `spliceLatLngs`, `addLatLng`, `getLatLngs` methods to polylines and polygons.
 * Added `setLatLng` and `setRadius` methods to `Circle` and `CircleMarker`.
 * Improved `LatLngBounds contains` method to accept `LatLng` in addition to `LatLngBounds`, the same for `Bounds contains` and `Point` 
 * Improved `LatLngBounds` & `Bounds` to allow their instantiation without arguments (by [@snc](https://github.com/snc)).
 * Added TMS tile numbering support through `TileLayer` `scheme: 'tms'` option (by [@tmcw](https://github.com/tmcw)).
 * Added `TileLayer` `noWrap` option to disable wrapping `x` tile coordinate (by [@jasondavies](https://github.com/jasondavies)).
 * Added `opacity` option and `setOpacity` method to `TileLayer`.
 * Added `setLatLng` and `setIcon` methods to `Marker`.
 * Added `title` option to `Marker`.
 * Added `maxZoom` argument to `map.locateAndSetView` method.
 * Added ability to pass Geolocation options to map `locate` and `locateAndSetView` methods (by [@JasonSanford](https://github.com/JasonSanford)).
 * Improved `Popup` to accept HTML elements in addition to strings as its content.
 
#### Development workflow improvements
 
 * Added `Makefile` for building `leaflet.js` on non-Windows machines (by [@tmcw](https://github.com/tmcw)).
 * Improved `debug/leaflet-include.js` script to allow using it outside of `debug` folder (by [@antonj](https://github.com/antonj)).
 * Improved `L` definition to be compatible with CommonJS. [#122](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/122)
 
### Bug fixes

 * Fixed a bug where some tiles would not load when panning across the date line. [#97](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/97)
 * Fixed a bug where map div with `position: absolute` is reset to `relative`. [#100](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/100) 
 * Fixed a bug that caused an error when trying to add a marker without shadow in its icon.
