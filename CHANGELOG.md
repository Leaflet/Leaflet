## 0.4 (July 30, 2012)

### API simplification

Leaflet 0.4 contains several API improvements that allow simpler, jQuery-like syntax ([example](https://gist.github.com/3038879)) while being backwards compatible with the previous approach (so you can use both styles):

 * Improved most methods and options to accept `LatLng`, `LatLngBounds`, `Point` and `Bounds` values in an array form (e.g. `map.panTo([lat, lng])` will be the same as `map.panTo(new L.LatLng(lat, lng))`)
 * Added `addTo` method to all layer classes, e.g. `marker.addTo(map)` is equivalent to `map.addLayer(marker)`
 * Added factory methods to most classes to be able to write code without `new` keyword, named the same as classes but starting with a lowercase letter, e.g. `L.map('map')` is the same as `new L.Map('map')`

### Notable new features

 * Added configurable **panning inertia** - after a quick pan, the map slows down in the same direction.
 * Added **keyboard navigation** for panning/zooming with keyboard arrows and +/- keys (by [@ericmmartinez](https://github.com/ericmmartinez)). [#663](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/663) [#646](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/646)
 * Added smooth **zoom animation of markers, vector layers, image overlays and popups** (by [@danzel](https://github.com/danzel)). [#740](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/740) [#758](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/758)
 * Added **Android 4+ pinch-zoom** support (by [@danzel](https://github.com/danzel)). [#774](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/774)
 * Added **polyline and polygon editing**. [#174](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/174)
 * Added an unobtrusive **scale control**.
 * Added **DivIcon** class that easily allows you to create lightweight div-based markers.
 * Added **Rectangle** vector layer (by [@JasonSanford](https://github.com/JasonSanford)). [#504](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/504)

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * Improved zooming so that you don't get a blank map when you zoom in or out twice quickly (by [@danzel](https://github.com/danzel)). [#7](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/7) [#729](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/729)
 * Drag-panning now works even when there are markers in the starting point (helps on maps with lots of markers). [#506](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/506)
 * Improved panning performance even more (there are no wasted frames now).
 * Improved pinch-zoom performance in mobile Chrome and Firefox.
 * Improved map performance on window resize.
 * Replaced box-shadow with border on controls for mobile devices to improve performance.
 * Slightly improved default popup styling.
 * Added `TileLayer` `detectRetina` option (`false` by default) that makes tiles show in a higher resolution on iOS retina displays (by [@Mithgol](https://github.com/Mithgol)). [#586](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/586)

#### GeoJSON API changes

GeoJSON API was improved to be simpler and more flexible ([example](https://gist.github.com/3062900)). The changes are not backwards-compatible, so be sure to update your old code.

 * Added `style` option for styling vector layers, passed either as an object or as a function (to style vector layers according to GeoJSON properties).
 * Added `filter` option to leave out features that don't correspond to a certain criteria (e.g. based on properties).
 * Added `onEachFeature` option to execute certain code on each feature layer based on its properties (binding popups, etc).
 * Changed `pointToLayer` function signature to provide `geojson` in addition to `latlng` when creating point features for more flexibility.

#### Icon API changes

Icon API was improved to be more flexible, but one of the changes is backwards-incompatible: you now need to pass different icon properties (like `iconUrl`) inside an options object ([example](https://gist.github.com/3076084)).

 * Converted `Icon` properties to options, changed constructor signature to `Icon(options)`.
 * Moved default marker icon options to `L.Icon.Default` class (which extends from `L.Icon`).
 * Added `Icon` `className` option to assign a custom class to an icon.
 * Added `Icon` `shadowAnchor` option to set the anchor of the shadow.
 * Made all `Icon` options except `iconUrl` optional (if not specified, they'll be chosen automatically or implemented using CSS). Anchor is centered by default (if size is specified), and otherwise can be set through CSS using negative margins.

#### Control API changes

 * Added `setPosition` and `getPosition` to all controls, as well as ability to pass certain position as an option when creating a control.
 * Made controls implementation easier (now more magic happens under the hood).
 * Replaced ugly control position constants (e.g. `L.Control.Position.TOP_LEFT`) with light strings (`'topleft'`, `'bottomright'`, etc.)

#### Other breaking API changes

 * Improved `TileLayer` constructor to interpolate URL template values from options (removed third `urlParams` argument).
 * Changed `TileLayer` `scheme: 'tms'` option to `tms: true`.
 * Removed `Map` `locateAndSetView` method (use `locate` with `setView: true` option)
 * Changed popup `minWidth` and `maxWidth` options to be applied to content element, not the whole popup.
 * Moved `prefix` argument to `options` in `Control.Attribution` constructor.
 * Renamed `L.VERSION` to `L.version`.

#### Other API improvements

 * Improved `on` and `off` methods to also accept `(eventHash[, context])`, as well as multiple space-separated events (by [@Guiswa](https://github.com/Guiswa)). [#770](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/770)
 * Improved `off` to remove all listeners of the event if no function was specified (by [@Guiswa](https://github.com/Guiswa)). [#770](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/770) [#691](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/691)
 * Added `TileLayer` `setZIndex` method for controlling the order of tile layers (thanks to [@mattcurrie](https://github.com/mattcurrie)). [#837](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/837)
 * Added `Control.Layers` `autoZIndex` option (on by default) to preserve the order of tile layers when switching.
 * Added `TileLayer` `redraw` method for re-requesting tiles (by [@greeninfo](https://github.com/greeninfo)). [#719](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/719)
 * Added `TileLayer` `setUrl` method for dynamically changing the tile URL template.
 * Added `bringToFront` and `bringToBack` methods to `TileLayer`, `ImageOverlay` and vector layers. [#185](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/185) [#505](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/505)
 * Added `TileLayer` `loading` event that fires when its tiles start to load (thanks to [@lapinos03](https://github.com/lapinos03)). [#177](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/177)
 * Added `TileLayer.WMS` `setParams` method for setting WMS parameters at runtime (by [@greeninfo](https://github.com/greeninfo)). [#719](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/719)
 * Added `TileLayer.WMS` subdomain support (`{s}` in the url) (by [@greeninfo](https://github.com/greeninfo)). [#735](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/735)

 * Added `dashArray` option to vector layers for making dashed strokes (by [jacobtoye](https://github.com/jacobtoye)). [#821](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/821) [#165](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/165)
 * Added `Circle` `getBounds` method. [#440](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/440)
 * Added `Circle` `getLatLng` and `getRadius` methods (by [@Guiswa](https://github.com/Guiswa)). [#655](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/655)
 * Added `openPopup` method to all vector layers. [#246](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/246)
 * Added public `redraw` method to vector layers (useful if you manipulate their `LatLng` points directly).
 * Added `Marker` `opacity` option and `setOpacity` method.
 * Added `Marker` `update` method. [#392](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/392)

 * Fixed a regression where default marker icons wouldn't work if Leaflet include url contained a query string.
 * Fixed a regression where tiles sometimes flickered with black on panning in iOS.

## 0.3 (February 13, 2012)

### Major features

 * Added **Canvas backend** for vector layers (polylines, polygons, circles). This enables vector support on Android < 3, and it can also be optionally preferred over SVG for a performance gain in some cases. Thanks to [@florianf](https://github.com/florianf) for a big part of this work.
 * Added **layers control** (`Control.Layers`) for convenient layer switching.
 * Added ability to set **max bounds** within which users can pan/zoom. [#93](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/93)

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * Map now preserves its center after resize.
 * When panning to another copy of the world (that's infinite horizontally), map overlays now jump to corresponding positions. [#273](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/273)
 * Limited maximum zoom change on a single mouse wheel movement (so you won't zoom across the whole zoom range in one scroll). [#149](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/149)
 * Significantly improved line simplification performance (noticeable when rendering polylines/polygons with tens of thousands of points)
 * Improved circles performance by not drawing them if they're off the clip region.
 * Improved stability of zoom animation (less flickering of tiles).

#### API improvements

 * Added ability to add a tile layer below all others (`map.addLayer(layer, true)`) (useful for switching base tile layers).

 * Added `TileLayer` `continuousWorld` option to disable tile coordinates checking/wrapping.
 * Added `TileLayer` `tileunload` event fired when tile gets removed after panning (by [@CodeJosch](https://github.com/CodeJosch)). [#256](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/256)

 * Added `FeatureGroup` `invoke` method to call a particular method on all layers of the group with the given arguments.
 * Added `ImageOverlay` `load` event. [#213](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/213)
 * Added `minWidth` option to `Popup` (by [@marphi](https://github.com/marphi)). [#214](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/214)

## 0.2.1 (2011-06-18)

 * Fixed regression that caused error in `TileLayer.Canvas`.

## 0.2 (2011-06-17)

### Major features

 * Added **WMS** support (`TileLayer.WMS` layer).
 * Added different **projections** support, having `EPSG:3857`, `EPSG:4326` and `EPSG:3395` out of the box (through `crs` option in `Map`). Thanks to [@Miroff](https://github.com/Miroff) & [@Komzpa](https://github.com/Komzpa) for great advice and explanation regarding this.
 * Added **GeoJSON** layer support.

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * Improved panning performance in Chrome and FF considerably with the help of `requestAnimationFrame`. [#130](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/130)
 * Improved click responsiveness in mobile WebKit (now it happens without delay). [#26](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/26)
 * Added tap tolerance (so click happens even if you moved your finger slighly when tapping).
 * Improved geolocation error handling: better error messages, explicit timeout, set world view on locateAndSetView failure. [#61](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/61)

#### API improvements

 * Added **MultiPolyline** and **MultiPolygon** layers. [#77](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/77)
 * Added **LayerGroup** and **FeatureGroup** layers for grouping other layers.
 * Added **TileLayer.Canvas** for easy creation of canvas-based tile layers.
 * Changed `Circle` to be zoom-dependent (with radius in meters); circle of a permanent size is now called `CircleMarker`.
 * Added `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to map, markers and paths; added map `mousemove` event.
 * Added `setLatLngs`, `spliceLatLngs`, `addLatLng`, `getLatLngs` methods to polylines and polygons.
 * Added `setLatLng` and `setRadius` methods to `Circle` and `CircleMarker`.
 * Improved `LatLngBounds contains` method to accept `LatLng` in addition to `LatLngBounds`, the same for `Bounds contains` and `Point`
 * Improved `LatLngBounds` & `Bounds` to allow their instantiation without arguments (by [@snc](https://github.com/snc)).
 * Added TMS tile numbering support through `TileLayer` `scheme: 'tms'` option (by [@tmcw](https://github.com/tmcw)).
 * Added `TileLayer` `noWrap` option to disable wrapping `x` tile coordinate (by [@jasondavies](https://github.com/jasondavies)).
 * Added `opacity` option and `setOpacity` method to `TileLayer`.
 * Added `setLatLng` and `setIcon` methods to `Marker`.
 * Added `title` option to `Marker`.
 * Added `maxZoom` argument to `map.locateAndSetView` method.
 * Added ability to pass Geolocation options to map `locate` and `locateAndSetView` methods (by [@JasonSanford](https://github.com/JasonSanford)).
 * Improved `Popup` to accept HTML elements in addition to strings as its content.

#### Development workflow improvements

 * Added `Makefile` for building `leaflet.js` on non-Windows machines (by [@tmcw](https://github.com/tmcw)).
 * Improved `debug/leaflet-include.js` script to allow using it outside of `debug` folder (by [@antonj](https://github.com/antonj)).
