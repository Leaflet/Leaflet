Leaflet Changelog
=================

(all changes without author notice are by [@mourner](https://github.com/mourner))

## 0.8-dev (master)

An in-progress version being developed on the `master` branch. Includes `stable` branch fixes.

This version contains a lot of beneficial but potentially breaking changes (especially if you're a plugin author), so please read through the changes carefully before upgrading.

### Vectors refactoring

Leaflet vector layers rendering got a major rewrite, making it possible to switch between rendering backends (Canvas, SVG) dynamically (and even use both for different layers at the same time), have more than one physical pane for vector layers, significantly improving Canvas performance and adding retina support, getting rid of ugly hacks and generally making the code much cleaner. PR [#2290](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2290).

* Added `Renderer` layer (inherited by SVG/Canvas implementations) that handles renderer bounds and zoom animation.
* Added `SVG` & `Canvas` classes that now contain all renderer-specific code for vector layers and can be added as layers to the map.
* All vector layer classes (`Path`, `Polyline`, etc.) now don't contain any renderer-specific code and instead can be passed a renderer layer to use as `renderer` in options;
* Removed `MultiPolyline` and `MultiPolygon` classes since multiple rings are now handled by `Polyline` and `Polygon` classes respectively. Layers with multiple rings now perform much better (since each is now physically a single path object instead of being a `FeatureGroup` of layers).
* **Dramatically improved performance of interactive Canvas layers**. Mouse events work much faster (due to improved hit detection algorithms), and layers get updated many times faster (with partial redraws instead of redrawing the whole Canvas).
* **Dramatically improved performance of interactive SVG layers** (e.g. creating a big GeoJSON layer and adding to a map got 3x faster while taking 2.5x less memory). [#2240](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/2240) [#2315](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/2315)
* Added retina support for Canvas layers.
* Improved default vector layer styles.
* Added `Polyline` and `Polygon` `getCenter` for getting centroids.
* Respectively, improved `Polyline` and `Polygon` popup positioning when calling `openPopup`.
* Improved `Polyline`/`Polygon` `getBounds` to be cached (so it works much faster).
* Changed `Circle` to inherit from `CircleMarker` and not the other way.
* Fixed `GeoJSON` `resetStyle` to work properly in case `style` option wasn't set.
* Fixed a bug where map fired `moveend` when updating Canvas layers.

### Layers refactoring

All Leaflet layers (including markers, popups, tile and vector layers) have been refactored to have a common parent, `Layer` class, that shares the basic logic of adding and removing. The leads to the following changes (documented in PR [#2266](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2266)):

* Added `Layer` class which all layers added to a map should inherit from.
* Added `add` and `remove` events to all layers.
* Added `remove` method to layers and controls (`marker.remove()` is now equivalent to `map.removeLayer(marker)`).
* Improved performance of adding and removing layers.
* Added `pane` option to all layers that can be changed (e.g. you can set `pane: 'overlayPane'` to a tile layer).
* Added `map` `createPane` method for custom panes. [#1742](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/1742)
* Simplified map panes &mdash; removed `objectsPane`, all panes are on the same level now.
* Added `shadowPane` option to markers as well.
* Added `getEvents` method to all layers that returns an `{event: listener, ...}` hash; layers now manage its listeners automatically without having to do this in `onAdd`/`onRemove`.
* Added `togglePopup`, `setPopupContent`, `getPopup` methods to all layers. [#2279](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/2279) [#2292](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/2292)
* Improved performance of adding/removing layers with layers control present (instead of listening to any layer add/remove, the control only listens to layers added in configuration).
* Fixed `FeatureGroup` `getBounds` to work correctly when containing circle markers.
* Removed `Map` `tilelayersload` event.
* Removed `Popup` `open` and `close` events in favor of `add` and `remove` for consistency.
* Moved all layer-related logic in `Map.js` to `Layer.js`.

### TileLayer & Projections refactoring

TileLayer code and everything projections-related has undergone a major refactoring, documented in PR [#2247](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2247). It includes the following changes (in addition to much cleaner and simpler code):

#### TileLayer-related changes

These changes make implementing custom grid-like layers for Leaflet much easier.

* Moved most of the `TileLayer` logic into the new `GridLayer` class (which `TileLayer` now inherits, extending it with logic specific to tile servers).
* Removed `TileLayer.Canvas` in favor of the much more flexible and powerful `GridLayer`.
* Improved tile wrapping and bounding logic in `TileLayer` to work transparently and completely depent on the CRS used; removed the need for `TileLayer` hacks when using custom projections.
* Removed `url` property in `tileload` and `tileloadstart` events (get it through `tile.src`).

#### Projections-related changes

These changes were targeted at removing any hardcoded projection-specific logic accross Leaflet classes, making it transparent and driven by the chosen CRS. They make using Leaflet with custom projections (including flat maps) much easier, and remove the need for ugly hacks in the [Proj4Leaflet](https://github.com/kartena/Proj4Leaflet) plugin.

* Added `CRS.Earth` which serves as a base for all Earth-based CRS (`EPSG3857` etc.). [#2345](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2345)
* Added `Projection` `bounds` property that defines bounds for different projections (`Mercator`, etc.) in projected coordinates (by [@perliedman](https://github.com/perliedman)).
* Added `CRS` `wrapLat` and `wrapLng` properties which define whether the world wraps on a given axis and in what range. Set as `[-180, 180]` for `EPSG:3857`, `EPSG:4326`, `EPSG:3395` by default.
* Added `CRS` and `Map` `wrapLatLng` (the latter depends on the chosen CRS).
* Added `CRS` `infinite` property that disables boundaries (the world can go on infinitely in any direction), default for `CRS.Simple`.
* Added `CRS` `getProjectedBounds` and `Map` `getPixelWorldBounds` methods that returns world bounds in projected coordinates depending on zoom (derived from `Projection` `bounds`) (by [@perliedman](https://github.com/perliedman)).
* Added `CRS` `unproject` method that converts coordinates in CRS-dependent units into `LatLng` coordinates (by [@sowelie](https://github.com/sowelie)).
* Added `Map` `distance(latlng1, latlng2)` method that takes CRS into account and works with flat projections.  [#2345](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2345) [#1442](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/1442)
* Improved `Circle` to be approximated with an ellipse in Earth-based projections. [#2345](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2345)
* Fixed `EPSG:4326` to have correct tile pyramid (2x1 tiles at root).
* Fixed `Projection.SphericalMercator` to project to meter units (by [@calvinmetcalf](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf)).
* Fixed `Map` `worldCopyJump` option to work for other projections.
* Fixed `Circle` to work with flat projections. [#2345](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2345) [#1465](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/1465)
* Fixed scale control precision in non-EPSG:3857 projections. [#2345](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2345)

### Animations refactoring

* Improved performance in iOS Safari; pinch-zooming should be smoother now. [#2377](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2377)
* Fixed gaps between tiles during animations in desktop Safari. [#2377](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2377)
* Improved panning inertia behavior so that there are no tearing during animation when panning around quickly. [#2360](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/2360)

## Other performance improvements

* Significantly [improved](http://jsperf.com/leaflet-parsefloat-in-latlng/2) `LatLng` creation performance (8x).
* Improved performance of layer objects construction.
* Significantly improved `FeatureGroup` (and correspondingly `GeoJSON`) layer adding and events performance (about 10x) by implementing a much better event propagation mechanism. [#2311](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2311)
* Improved Leaflet events and DOM events memory footprint.
* Improved `Evented` `off` performance by about 2 times.

### Misc usability improvements

* Added popup fade out animation.
* Improved keyboard support to ignore keystrokes with modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Meta) to not interfere with OS shortcuts.

### Other breaking API changes

* Changed `DomUtil` `off` to require `context` attribute if you remove a listener that was previously added with a particular context.
* Removed `DomUtil.getViewportOffset` method as it is no longer necessary.
* Removed `DomUtil` `getTranslateString` and `getScaleString` methods.
* Removed `DomUtil` `documentIsLtr` method.
* Removed `LatLng` `RAD_TO_DEG`, `DEG_TO_RAD` and `MAX_MARGIN` constants.
* Renamed `Util.limitExecByInterval` to `Util.throttle`.

### Other API improvements

* Added `Evented` class that now many Leaflet classes inherit from (instead of mixing in events methods in each class), while keeping the old `includes: L.Mixin.Events` syntax available. [#2310](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2310)
* Improved `Class` `options` to be prototypically inherited instead of copied over in children classes, which leads to more efficient memory use, faster object construction times and ability to change parent options that get propagated to all children automatically (by [@jfirebaugh](https://github.com/jfirebaugh)). [#2300](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2300) [#2294](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/2294)

* Added `Point` `ceil` method (by [@perliedman](https://github.com/perliedman)).
* Added `Util.wrapNum` method for wrapping a number to lie in a certain range.
* Improved `L.bind` to use native `Function` `bind` on modern browsers and prepend real arguments to bound ones.
* Added `LatLng` `equals` second argument `maxMargin`.
* Added `DomUtil` `setClass` and `getClass` methods.
* Improve `Marker` `move` event to include `oldLatlng` (by [@danzel](https://github.com/danzel)). [#2412](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2412)
* Improved `DomEvent` `on`/`off` to accept space-separated events and object literals (`{type: fn}`).
* Added `DomUtil` `toFront` and `toBack` methods.
* Added `Evented` `listens` as a shortcut to `hasEventListeners`.
* Added optional support for center-oriented scroll for `L.map` option `touchZoom` (by [@mtmail](https://github.com/mtmail)). [#2527](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/2527)

## 0.5 (January 17, 2013)

### Breaking changes

Be sure to read through these changes to avoid any issues when upgrading from older versions:

## 0.4.4 (August 7, 2012)

### Improvements

 * Improved `GeoJSON` `setStyle` to also accept function (like the corresponding option).
 * Added `GeoJSON` `resetStyle(layer)`, useful for resetting hover state.

## 0.4 (July 30, 2012)

### API simplification

Leaflet 0.4 contains several API improvements that allow simpler, jQuery-like syntax ([example](https://gist.github.com/3038879)) while being backwards compatible with the previous approach (so you can use both styles):

 * Improved most methods and options to accept `LatLng`, `LatLngBounds`, `Point` and `Bounds` values in an array form (e.g. `map.panTo([lat, lng])` will be the same as `map.panTo(new L.LatLng(lat, lng))`)
 * Added `addTo` method to all layer classes, e.g. `marker.addTo(map)` is equivalent to `map.addLayer(marker)`
 * Added factory methods to most classes to be able to write code without `new` keyword, named the same as classes but starting with a lowercase letter, e.g. `L.map('map')` is the same as `new L.Map('map')`

### Notable new features

 * Added configurable **panning inertia** - after a quick pan, the map slows down in the same direction.
 * Added **keyboard navigation** for panning/zooming with keyboard arrows and +/- keys (by [@ericmmartinez](https://github.com/ericmmartinez)). [#663](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/663) [#646](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/646)
 * Added smooth **zoom animation of markers, vector layers, image overlays and popups** (by [@danzel](https://github.com/danzel)). [#740](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/740) [#758](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/758)
 * Added **Android 4+ pinch-zoom** support (by [@danzel](https://github.com/danzel)). [#774](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/774)
 * Added **polyline and polygon editing**. [#174](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/174)
 * Added an unobtrusive **scale control**.
 * Added **DivIcon** class that easily allows you to create lightweight div-based markers.
 * Added **Rectangle** vector layer (by [@JasonSanford](https://github.com/JasonSanford)). [#504](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/504)

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * Improved zooming so that you don't get a blank map when you zoom in or out twice quickly (by [@danzel](https://github.com/danzel)). [#7](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/7) [#729](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/729)
 * Drag-panning now works even when there are markers in the starting point (helps on maps with lots of markers). [#506](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/506)
 * Improved panning performance even more (there are no wasted frames now).
 * Improved pinch-zoom performance in mobile Chrome and Firefox.
 * Improved map performance on window resize.
 * Replaced box-shadow with border on controls for mobile devices to improve performance.
 * Slightly improved default popup styling.
 * Added `TileLayer` `detectRetina` option (`false` by default) that makes tiles show in a higher resolution on iOS retina displays (by [@Mithgol](https://github.com/Mithgol)). [#586](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/586)

#### GeoJSON API changes

GeoJSON API was improved to be simpler and more flexible ([example](https://gist.github.com/3062900)). The changes are not backwards-compatible, so be sure to update your old code.

 * Added `style` option for styling vector layers, passed either as an object or as a function (to style vector layers according to GeoJSON properties).
 * Added `filter` option to leave out features that don't correspond to a certain criteria (e.g. based on properties).
 * Added `onEachFeature` option to execute certain code on each feature layer based on its properties (binding popups, etc).
 * Changed `pointToLayer` function signature to provide `geojson` in addition to `latlng` when creating point features for more flexibility.

#### Icon API changes

Icon API was improved to be more flexible, but one of the changes is backwards-incompatible: you now need to pass different icon properties (like `iconUrl`) inside an options object ([example](https://gist.github.com/3076084)).

 * Converted `Icon` properties to options, changed constructor signature to `Icon(options)`.
 * Moved default marker icon options to `L.Icon.Default` class (which extends from `L.Icon`).
 * Added `Icon` `className` option to assign a custom class to an icon.
 * Added `Icon` `shadowAnchor` option to set the anchor of the shadow.
 * Made all `Icon` options except `iconUrl` optional (if not specified, they'll be chosen automatically or implemented using CSS). Anchor is centered by default (if size is specified), and otherwise can be set through CSS using negative margins.

#### Control API changes

 * Added `setPosition` and `getPosition` to all controls, as well as ability to pass certain position as an option when creating a control.
 * Made controls implementation easier (now more magic happens under the hood).
 * Replaced ugly control position constants (e.g. `L.Control.Position.TOP_LEFT`) with light strings (`'topleft'`, `'bottomright'`, etc.)

#### Other breaking API changes

 * Improved `TileLayer` constructor to interpolate URL template values from options (removed third `urlParams` argument).
 * Changed `TileLayer` `scheme: 'tms'` option to `tms: true`.
 * Removed `Map` `locateAndSetView` method (use `locate` with `setView: true` option)
 * Changed popup `minWidth` and `maxWidth` options to be applied to content element, not the whole popup.
 * Moved `prefix` argument to `options` in `Control.Attribution` constructor.
 * Renamed `L.VERSION` to `L.version`.

#### Other API improvements

 * Improved `on` and `off` methods to also accept `(eventHash[, context])`, as well as multiple space-separated events (by [@Guiswa](https://github.com/Guiswa)). [#770](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/770)
 * Improved `off` to remove all listeners of the event if no function was specified (by [@Guiswa](https://github.com/Guiswa)). [#770](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/770) [#691](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/691)
 * Added `TileLayer` `setZIndex` method for controlling the order of tile layers (thanks to [@mattcurrie](https://github.com/mattcurrie)). [#837](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/837)

 * Added `dashArray` option to vector layers for making dashed strokes (by [jacobtoye](https://github.com/jacobtoye)). [#821](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/821) [#165](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/165)
 * Added `Circle` `getBounds` method. [#440](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/440)
 * Added `Circle` `getLatLng` and `getRadius` methods (by [@Guiswa](https://github.com/Guiswa)). [#655](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/655)

 * Added public `redraw` method to vector layers (useful if you manipulate their `LatLng` points directly).
 * Added `Marker` `opacity` option and `setOpacity` method.
 * Added `Marker` `update` method. [#392](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/392)

## 0.3.1 (February 14, 2012)

 * Fixed a regression where default marker icons wouldn't work if Leaflet include url contained a query string.
 * Fixed a regression where tiles sometimes flickered with black on panning in iOS.

## 0.3 (February 13, 2012)

### Major features

 * Added **Canvas backend** for vector layers (polylines, polygons, circles). This enables vector support on Android < 3, and it can also be optionally preferred over SVG for a performance gain in some cases. Thanks to [@florianf](https://github.com/florianf) for a big part of this work.
 * Added **layers control** (`Control.Layers`) for convenient layer switching.
 * Added ability to set **max bounds** within which users can pan/zoom. [#93](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/93)

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * Map now preserves its center after resize.
 * When panning to another copy of the world (that's infinite horizontally), map overlays now jump to corresponding positions. [#273](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/273)
 * Limited maximum zoom change on a single mouse wheel movement (so you won't zoom across the whole zoom range in one scroll). [#149](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/149)
 * Significantly improved line simplification performance (noticeable when rendering polylines/polygons with tens of thousands of points)
 * Improved circles performance by not drawing them if they're off the clip region.
 * Improved stability of zoom animation (less flickering of tiles).

#### API improvements

 * Added ability to add a tile layer below all others (`map.addLayer(layer, true)`) (useful for switching base tile layers).
