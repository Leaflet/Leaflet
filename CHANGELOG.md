Leaflet Changelog
=================

(all changes without author notice are by [@mourner](https://github.com/mourner))

## 0.4 (master)

An in-progress version being developed on the master branch.

### Notable new features

 * Added configurable **panning inertia** - after a quick pan, the map slows down in the same direction.
 * Added **polyline and polygon editing**. [#174](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/174)
 * Added an unobtrusive **scale control**.
 * Added `DivIcon` class that easily allows you to create lightweight div-based markers.
 * Added `Rectangle` vector layer (by [@JasonSanford](https://github.com/JasonSanford)). [#504](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/504)

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * Drag-panning now works even when there are markers in the starting point (helps on maps with lots of markers). [#506](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/506)
 * Improved panning performance even more (there are no wasted frames now).
 * Replaced box-shadow with border on controls for mobile devices to improve performance.
 * Slightly improved default popup styling.

#### Breaking API changes

 * Converted `Icon` properties (like `iconUrl`) to options, changed constructor signature to `Icon(options)`.
 * Moved default marker icon options to `L.Icon.Default` class (which extends from `L.Icon`).
 * Improved `TileLayer` constructor to interpolate URL template values from options (removed third `urlParams` argument).
 * Replaced ugly control position constants (e.g. L.Control.Position.TOP_LEFT) with light strings ('topleft', 'bottomright', etc.)
 * Removed `Map` `locateAndSetView` method (use `locate` with `setView: true` option)
 * Changed popup `minWidth` and `maxWidth` options to be applied to content element, not the whole popup.
 * Moved `prefix` argument to `options` in `Control.Attribution` constructor.

#### Other API improvements

 * Added `Icon` `className` option to assign a custom class to an icon.
 * Added `Icon` `shadowOffset` option to set the position of shadow relative to the icon.
 * Made all `Icon` options except `iconUrl` optional (if not specified, they'll be chosen automatically or implemented using CSS). Anchor is centered by default (if size is specified), and otherwise can be set through CSS using negative margins.
 * Added `originalEvent` property to `MouseEvent` (by [@k4](https://github.com/k4)). [#521](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/521)
 * Added `Circle` `getBounds` method. [#440](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/440)
 * Added `Marker` `opacity` option.
 * Added public `redraw` method to vector layers (useful if you manipulate their `LatLng` points directly).
 * Added `setPosition` and `getPosition` to all controls, as well as ability to pass certain position as an option when creating a control.
 * Added `Popup` `maxHeight` option that makes content inside the popup scrolled if it doesn't fit the specified max height.
 * Made controls implementation easier (now more magic happens under the hood).
 * Added `Map` `containerPointToLatLng` and `latLngToContainerPoint` methods. [#474](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/474)
 * Added `containerPoint` property to `MouseEvent`. [#413](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/413)
 * Added `LatLngBounds` `pad` method that returns bounds extended by a percentage (by [@jacobtoye](https://github.com/jacobtoye)). [#492](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/492)
 * Added `contextmenu` event to vector layers (by [@ErrorProne](https://github.com/ErrorProne)). [#500](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/500)
 * Added chaining to `DomEvent` methods.
 * Added `Map` `addHandler` method.
 * Moved dragging cursor styles from JS code to CSS.
 * Improved `Marker` `openPopup` not to raise an error if it doesn't have a popup. [#507](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/507)

 * Fixed a bug that caused jumping/stuttering of panning animation in some cases.
 * Fixed a bug where popup size was calculated incorrectly in IE.
 * Fixed a bug where cursor would flicker when dragging a marker.

#### Mobile browser bugfixes

 * Fixed a bug with false map click events on pinch-zoom and zoom/layers controls click. [#485](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/485)
 * Fixed a bug where touching the map with two or more fingers simultaneously would raise an error.
 * Fixed a bug where zoom control wasn't always visible on Android 3. [#335](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/335)

## 0.3.1 (February 14, 2012)

 * Fixed a regression where default marker icons wouldn't work if Leaflet include url contained a query string.
 * Fixed a regression where tiles sometimes flickered with black on panning in iOS.

## 0.3 (February 13, 2012)

### Major features

 * Added **Canvas backend** for vector layers (polylines, polygons, circles). This enables vector support on Android < 3, and it can also be optionally preferred over SVG for a performance gain in some cases. Thanks to [@florianf](https://github.com/florianf) for a big part of this work.
 * Added **layers control** (`Control.Layers`) for convenient layer switching.
 * Added ability to set **max bounds** within which users can pan/zoom. [#93](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/93)

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * When panning to another copy of the world (that's infinite horizontally), map overlays now jump to corresponding positions. [#273](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/273)
 * Limited maximum zoom change on a single mouse wheel movement (so you won't zoom across the whole zoom range in one scroll). [#149](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/149)
 * Significantly improved line simplification performance (noticeable when rendering polylines/polygons with tens of thousands of points)
 * Improved circles performance by not drawing them if they're off the clip region.
 * Improved stability of zoom animation (less flickering of tiles).

#### API improvements

 * Added ability to add a tile layer below all others (`map.addLayer(layer, true)`) (useful for switching base tile layers).
 * Added `Map` `zoomstart` event (thanks to [@Fabiz](https://github.com/Fabiz)). [#377](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/377)
 * Improved `Map` `locate` method, added ability to watch location continuously and more options. [#212](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/212)

 * Added `Marker` `zIndexOffset` option to be able to set certain markers below/above others. [#65](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/65)
 * Added `urlParams` third optional argument to `TileLayer` constructor for convenience: an object with properties that will be evaluated in the URL template.
 * Added `TileLayer` `continuousWorld` option to disable tile coordinates checking/wrapping.
 * Added `TileLayer` `tileunload` event fired when tile gets removed after panning (by [@CodeJosch](https://github.com/CodeJosch)). [#256](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/256)

 * Added `ImageOverlay` `load` event. [#213](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/213)
 * Added `minWidth` option to `Popup` (by [@marphi](https://github.com/marphi)). [#214](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/214)
 * Improved `LatLng` constructor to be more tolerant (and throw descriptive error if latitude or longitude can't be interpreted as a number). [#136](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/136)
 * Added `LatLng` `distanceTo` method (great circle distance) (by [@mortenbekditlevsen](https://github.com/mortenbekditlevsen)). [#462](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/462)
