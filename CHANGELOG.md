Leaflet Changelog
=================

(all changes without author notice are by [@mourner](https://github.com/mourner))

## 0.4 (master)

### Improvements

 * Added `setPosition` and `getPosition` to all controls, as well as ability to pass certain position as an option when creating a control.
 * Replaced ugly control position constants (e.g. L.Control.Position.TOP_LEFT) with light strings ('topleft', 'bottomright', etc.)
 * Made controls implementation easier (now more magic happens under the hood).

### Bug fixes

 * Fixed a bug where `TileLayer.WMS` wouldn't take `insertAtTheBottom` option into account (by [@bmcbride](https://github.com/bmcbride)). [#478](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/478)

## 0.3.1 (14.02.2012)

 * Fixed a regression where default marker icons wouldn't work if Leaflet include url contained a query string.
 * Fixed a regression where tiles sometimes flickered with black on panning in iOS.

## 0.3 (13.02.2012)

### Major features

 * Added **Canvas backend** for vector layers (polylines, polygons, circles). This enables vector support on Android < 3, and it can also be optionally preferred over SVG for a performance gain in some cases. Thanks to [@florianf](https://github.com/florianf) for a big part of this work.
 * Added **layers control** (`Control.Layers`) for convenient layer switching.
 * Added ability to set **max bounds** within which users can pan/zoom. [#93](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/93)

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * Map now preserves its center after resize.
 * When panning to another copy of the world (that's infinite horizontally), map overlays now jump to corresponding positions. [#273](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/273)
 * Limited maximum zoom change on a single mouse wheel movement (so you won't zoom across the whole zoom range in one scroll). [#149](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/149)
 * Significantly improved line simplification performance (noticeable when rendering polylines/polygons with tens of thousands of points)
 * Improved circles performance by not drawing them if they're off the clip region.
 * Improved stability of zoom animation (less flickering of tiles).

#### API improvements

 * Added ability to add a tile layer below all others (`map.addLayer(layer, true)`) (useful for switching base tile layers).
 * Added `Map` `zoomstart` event (thanks to [@Fabiz](https://github.com/Fabiz)). [#377](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/377)
 * Improved `Map` `locate` method, added ability to watch location continuously and more options. [#212](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/212)

 * Added `hasLayer` method to `Map`.
 * Added `Marker` `zIndexOffset` option to be able to set certain markers below/above others. [#65](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/65)
 * Added `urlParams` third optional argument to `TileLayer` constructor for convenience: an object with properties that will be evaluated in the URL template.
 * Added `TileLayer` `continuousWorld` option to disable tile coordinates checking/wrapping.
 * Added `TileLayer` `tileunload` event fired when tile gets removed after panning (by [@CodeJosch](https://github.com/CodeJosch)). [#256](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/256)
 * Added `TileLayer` `zoomOffset` option useful for non-256px tiles (by [@msaspence](https://github.com/msaspence)).

 * Added `TileLayer.Canvas` `redraw` method (by [@mortenbekditlevsen](https://github.com/mortenbekditlevsen)). [#459](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/459)

 * Added `getBounds` method to `Polyline` and `Polygon` (by [@JasonSanford](https://github.com/JasonSanford)). [#253](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/253)
 * Added `FeatureGroup` `setStyle` method (also inherited by `MultiPolyline` and `MultiPolygon`). [#353](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/353)
 * Added `FeatureGroup` `invoke` method to call a particular method on all layers of the group with the given arguments.
 * Added `ImageOverlay` `load` event. [#213](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/213)
 * Added `minWidth` option to `Popup` (by [@marphi](https://github.com/marphi)). [#214](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/214)
 * Improved `LatLng` constructor to be more tolerant (and throw descriptive error if latitude or longitude can't be interpreted as a number). [#136](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/136)
 * Added `LatLng` `distanceTo` method (great circle distance) (by [@mortenbekditlevsen](https://github.com/mortenbekditlevsen)). [#462](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/462)

 * Improved browser-specific code to rely more on feature detection rather than user agent string.
 * Improved superclass access mechanism to work with inheritance chains of 3 or more classes; now you should use `Klass.superclass` instead of `this.superclass` (by [@anru](https://github.com/anru)). [#179](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/179)

#### Development workflow improvements

 * Build system completely overhauled to be based on Node.js, Jake, JSHint and UglifyJS.
 * All code is now linted for errors and conformity with a strict code style (with JSHint), and wont build unless the check passes.
