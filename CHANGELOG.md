Leaflet Changelog
=================

(all changes without author notice are by [@mourner](https://github.com/mourner))

## 0.3 (master)

### Major features

 * Added **Canvas backend** for vector layers (polylines, polygons, circles). This enables vector support on Android < 3, and it can also be optionally preferred over SVG for a performance gain in some cases. Thanks to [@florianf](https://github.com/florianf) for a big part of this work.
 * Added **layers control** (`Control.Layers`) for convenient layer switching.

### Improvements

#### Usability improvements

 * Map now preserves its center after resize.
 * Limited maximum zoom change on a single mouse wheel movement (so you won't zoom across the whole zoom range in one scroll). [#149](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/149)
 * Improved circles performance by not drawing them if they're off the clip region.

#### API improvements

 * Improved `LatLng` constructor to be more tolerant (and throw descriptive error if latitude or longitude can't be interpreted as a number). [#136](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/issues/136)
 * Added ability to add a tile layer below all others (`map.addLayer(layer, true)`) (useful for switching base tile layers).
 * Added `hasLayer` method to `Map`.
 * Added `TileLayer` `continuousWorld` option to disable tile coordinates checking/wrapping.
 * Added `Polyline` `closestLayerPoint` method that's can be useful for interaction features (by [@anru](https://github.com/anru)). [#186](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/186)
 * Added `setLatLngs` method to `MultiPolyline` and `MultiPolygon` (by [@anru](https://github.com/anru)). [#194](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/194)
 * Added `DomUtil.removeClass` method (by [@anru](https://github.com/anru)).
 * Improved browser-specific code to rely more on feature detection rather than user agent string.
 * Improved superclass access mechanism to work with inheritance chains of 3 or more classes; now you should use `Klass.superclass` instead of `this.superclass` (by [@anru](https://github.com/anru)). [#179](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/179)
 * Added `minWidth` option to `Popup` (by [@marphi](https://github.com/marphi)). [#214](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/214)
 * Added `TileLayer` `tileunload` event fired when tile gets removed after panning (by [@CodeJosch](https://github.com/CodeJosch)). [#256](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/256)
 * Added `LatLngBounds` `toBBoxString` method for convenience (by [@JasonSanford](https://github.com/JasonSanford)). [#263](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/263)
 * Added `getBounds` method to `Polyline` and `Polygon` (by [@JasonSanford](https://github.com/JasonSanford)). [#253](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet/pull/253)
