- [ ] I'm reporting a bug, not asking for help
- [ ] I've looked at the [documentation](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.0.html) to make sure the behaviour is documented and expected
- [ ] I'm sure this is a Leaflet code issue, not an issue with my own code nor with the framework I'm using (Cordova, Ionic, Angular, Reactâ€¦)
- [ ] I've searched through the issues to make sure it's not yet reported

## How to reproduce

- Leaflet version I'm using:
- Browser (with version) I'm using:
- OS/Platform (with version) I'm using:
