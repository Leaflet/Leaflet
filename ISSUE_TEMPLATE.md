<!--
Thanks for taking the time to open an issue! Help us have good bug requests:

- [ ] I'm reporting a bug, not asking for help; support questions like "How can I do X with Leaflet?" will be closed (use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) or [gis.stackexchange.com](http://gis.stackexchange.com/) for questions)
- [ ] I've looked at the [documentation](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.3.html) to make sure the behaviour is documented and expected
- [ ] I'm sure this is a Leaflet code issue, not an issue with my own code nor with the framework I'm using (Cordova, Ionic, Angular, Reactâ€¦)
- [ ] I've searched through the issues to make sure it's not yet reported
